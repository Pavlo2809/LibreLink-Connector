- Trend arrow (↑↑ rising rapidly, ↑ rising, → stable, ↓ falling, ↓↓ falling rapidly)
- Status indicator (Normal, High, Low)
- Target high/low ranges
- Last update timestamp
- Patient name
- Recent history of glucose readings

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- .NET 8.0 Runtime
- LibreLinkUp account with access to patient data

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from Source

1. Install [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Open a terminal in the project directory
4. Run the following commands:

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

### Option 2: Build Release Version

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false
```

The executable will be in `bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\`

## Usage

### First Time Setup

1. Launch the application
2. Enter your LibreLinkUp email and password
3. Check "Remember me" if you want to save your credentials for auto-login
4. Click "Login"

### Main Features

#### Auto-Update
- The application automatically refreshes glucose data every 5 minutes (configurable)
- You can manually refresh by clicking the "↻ Refresh" button

#### Settings
Click the "⚙ Settings" button to configure:
- **Update Interval**: Set how often to check for new readings (1-30 minutes)
- **Server Region**: Choose between European or Global LibreView server
- **Notifications**: Enable/disable notifications (future feature)
- **Thresholds**: Set custom high/low glucose alert thresholds

#### Security
- Credentials are encrypted using Windows Data Protection API
- Stored securely in: `%APPDATA%\LibreLinkConnector\credentials.dat`
- Only accessible by the current Windows user
- Can be deleted on logout

## API Information

This application uses the LibreLinkUp API to retrieve glucose data:
- **European Server**: `https://api-eu.libreview.io`
- **Global Server**: `https://api.libreview.io`

### Required Headers
```
product: llu.android
version: 4.2.1
```

### API Flow
1. Login → Get JWT Token
2. Get Connections → Retrieve Patient ID
3. Get Graph Data → Fetch glucose readings

## Configuration Files

The application stores configuration in:
- **Credentials**: `%APPDATA%\LibreLinkConnector\credentials.dat` (encrypted)
- **Settings**: `%APPDATA%\LibreLinkConnector\settings.json`

## Privacy & Security

- All credentials are encrypted using Windows Data Protection API
- No data is sent to third parties
- Direct communication with official LibreView API only
- JWT tokens are stored securely and automatically refreshed

## Troubleshooting

### Login Fails
- Verify your LibreLinkUp credentials
- Check your internet connection
- Try switching server region in Settings

### Auto-Update Not Working
- Check Settings → Update Interval is set correctly
- Ensure the application remains open
- Check if you have active internet connection

### Saved Credentials Not Working
- Try logging out and logging in again
- Delete saved credentials via Logout → Yes
